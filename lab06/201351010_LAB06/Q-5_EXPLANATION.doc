Instead of modifying the main function everytime, I chose to create a new class PollDBextended which inherits the methods of PollDB and performs enhanced functions. It helps in not creating a new main function everytime. I also created a PollSimulator_new class which simulates the PollDBextended class accorrding to its enhanced functionality. It performs the same work from its methods as it is inherited.
